**Background**
This poll is to gather the community's sentiment on [FIP-0014](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0014.md). Discussions about this FIP can be carried out in the original [FIP issue #56](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/issues/56).

**Proposal**
Allow the Maximum Lifetime of V1 Proof Sectors to be 540 Days

**Impact**

Please see here(TODO: Add link) for a report on the impact of accepting versus rejecting this FIP from [BlockScience](https://github.com/BlockScience). The report includes a summary of the background context, when these sectors will be expiring, and what the projected impact of their expiration would be on the storage power and sector collateral.

**Outcome**
Core implementers will make a final decision on whether the FIP should be accepted in the network based on the poll result and a final security audit.
