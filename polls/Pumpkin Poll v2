> Note: This is **NOT** a real poll for FIP discussion. 

**Background**
This *sample* poll is to test making FIL Polls and see how much the Foundations love their pumpkin flavored treats. This is the second version of this poll.
The first version was used for creating the poll; this version will be for surveying FF staff. 

**Proposal**
I am excited about 'pumpkin spice season'.
