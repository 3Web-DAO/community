**Background**
This poll is to gather the community's sentiment on [FIP-0014](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0014.md). Discussions about this FIP can be carried out in the original [FIP issue #56](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/issues/56).

**Proposal**
Allow all V1 proof sectors to be extended up to a maximum of 540 days in epoch as sectors' lifetime.

**Impact**
Please see this report(TODO: add link) from [BlockScience](https://github.com/BlockScience) to understand the impact of the V1 setocr expiration wave on Filecoin Cryptoecon metric.
