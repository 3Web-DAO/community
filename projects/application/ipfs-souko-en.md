## Project Description
IPFS SOUKO is a digital archive service that enables smooth uploading and downloading of data between conventional storage (including cloud) and IPFS/Filecoin distributed storage.

IPFS and Filecoin are cutting-edge technologies, and there are still very few people who are proficient in handling them. The simple UI/UX of IPFS SOUKO allows anyone to store (upload) or retrieve (download) their data to IPFS or Filecoin distributed storage.

NonEntropy Japan Launches Joint Research with Osaka University on
* The Optimization of the IPFS/Filecoin network performance, and labor-saving and data allocation in the distributed network.
* Security Enhancement to Promote IPFS/Filecoin Distributed Storage
