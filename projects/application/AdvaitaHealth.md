AdvaitaHealth 

## Category 
 Application

## Project Description
Combining evaluation of preventive-treatment wearable device with new infrastructure like 5G and IoT etc, Advaita Heal utilizes Polkdot ecology, merging with preventive-treatment ( Health Med) AI and builds the platform where efficacy of treatment is highly digitized and intelligentized.

### Pain point：
Promotion of health, management and warning of chronic disease, mental health can not be effectively developed due to lack of data.
1. Data island within hospital
2，No Health Med out of hospital leads to no subject, tool, and methodology.
3， Lack of methodology which quantitatively merge health data in multiple dimension.
4，Lack of effective data acquire equipment out of hospital
5， Treatments can not be promoted due to lack of trusty prove of efficacy of which.

### Methodology and Tool
1，Health Med: Qiming Zhang’s preventive-treatment guarantees the quantification of health.
2，Yi Flow Algorithm: discovering problems need to be improved and evaluating health trend in quantitative way.
3，Wearable devices that meet standard of Health Med
4，Trusty medical data on chain.

### Problems that can be solved
Major diseases can be intervened and treated effectively with data
1，Ability to adjust blood pressure/precaution of high blood pressure
2，Bio parameters resulting in depressive disorder 
3，Fertility problems caused by infirmity of lower limbs
4，Quantification of health management
5，Effective improvement in sleep

### Business Model：
Trusty data on chain + smart contract + pay according to efficacy

### Project Status
The development of the health watch is completed, and the blockchain is under development.

### Promotion：
1. Credentials of Chinese traditional medicine special project of Health committee, China Ministry of Industry and Information Technology + front end marketing of cooperated Chinese traditional medicine hospital
2，Diagnosis and prescription of wearable devices 
3，Trusty cases of treatment on chain

### Road Map：
1，Connecting homeopathy
2，Health competition
3，More application scenarios：healthcare 

### Technology path
The YingYang-Watch data is uploaded to IPFS, and the data hash is written to Polkadot. The web2.0 artificial intelligence algorithm obtains the data through IPFS, issues an evaluation report, and writes the evaluation results to Polkadot through chainlink, realizing a business model of paying based on curative effects.


## Project Status
The development of the health watch is completed, and the blockchain is under development.
