## Project Description
**Oppanda** is an experimental project to add support for creating off chain proposals with defined validators that can be funded. Proposals are defined off-chain and `proposal=> external validator url` is recorded onchain. Funds are transfered when external oracle validates that proposal is approved by validators. Currently proposals can be validated through tweets from validators and Off-chain signatures stored in IPFS.
Proposals and approval records are optionally stored in IPFS using Web3.Storage api.
