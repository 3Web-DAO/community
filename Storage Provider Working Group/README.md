# Filecoin Storage Provider Working Group

## Foreword
The Filecoin Storage Provider Working Group (SPWG), is an voluntary, non-paid working group that allows Filecoin storage providers of all sizes to work collaboratively with other esteemed storage providers on the Filecoin network.

Through partnerships with local storage providers in North America, Europe, and Asia, the SPWG aims to improve the mining experience for all Filecoin storage providers while also providing resources and education to bridge gaps between Filecoin storage providers and Filecoin developers, storage providers, and the broader community worldwide.

In this repo you will find the meeting notes from each regions working group.

## The Mission and Values of the SPWG
At its core, the Storage Provider Working Group serves the Filecoin network by making a host of resources, services, events, funding, and programs available to storage providers and other participants in the Filecoin network. By fostering collaboration and expanding opportunities for storage providers to provide input and exercise leadership for the Filecoin community, the SPWG seeks to vastly improve the Filecoin network as a whole.

As a working group designed to benefit all Filecoin storage providers, the SPWG is committed to promoting a diversity of perspectives. In particular, the SPWG seeks to foster the following three values in its representation of storage providers:

1. **Diversity in Power Size:** The SPWG will ensure that all voices and views are heard for storage providers of all power sizes. Large and small storage providers alike will have a say in the future of the Filecoin network.
2. **Diversity in Geography:** The SPWG will make sure the mining working group has an equal representation of storage providers across different geographies and time zones. No one geographic region should have an outsized influence over the SPWG.
3. **Access:** The SPWG will work to make sure all resources provided to mining communities are translated and distributed in a way that reaches every mining community. The Filecoin network is truly global in scope: education, resources, and opportunities must support the global character of the Filecoin community.

Additionally, all members of the Mining Working Group pledge to follow the [Filecoin Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
