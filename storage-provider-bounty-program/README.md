# Welcome to Filecoin Storage Provider-Bounty Board! 

The Filecoin Storage Provider Bounty Board focuses on development, specification, and implementation of priorities from Filecoin’s storage provider community. This is a similar initiative to the [IPFS bounty board](https://github.com/ipfs/devgrants/blob/master/BOUNTIES.md) but focused on storage providers. The goal of the Storage Provider Bounty Board is to:
- Improve Filecoin’s ecosystem and community support by working with community members and contributors.
- Motivate more contributors to participate in the Filecoin project and to solve open issues by rewarding ongoing & existing contributors that add significant value to Filecoin. 
 
## Bounties
Bounties are a good fit for simpler tasks like fixing minor bugs, adding test cases, updating or translating documentation, or building small, well-specified features. Bounties are priced based upon severity and urgency. Higher prioritized bounties would receive higher rewards. Prioritization and rewards are established by Filecoin Foundation and the Storage Provider Working Group.

Bounties can be small or large, technical or nontechnical. Regardless of who you are, what skills you have, or your prior participation in the Filecoin network, there may be ways for you to participate in the Bounty Board. Harness your writing, coding, or foreign language skills and give it a go! 

## Awarding System 
Bounties are monetary awards for completing eligible issues in the [Filecoin Storage Provider Bounty Board](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/projects/1). When the original issue is closed by a pull request, the author of that pull request is considered eligible for the bounty. Bounties ranges from $50 to $5,000 (or equivalent FIL). Awards are determined based on the urgency and complexity of the task at hand. Rewards are determined by the Filecoin Foundation and Storage Provider Working Group. 

## How to Submit an Issue
Open issues can be proposed by anyone in the Filecoin community. Filecoin Foundation provides templates to help address your issue to make sure you describe them clearly and as detail as possible. To propose an issue, please [raise them here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/issues). 

## Contributing to an open issue
Please leave a comment within the issue, requesting to be assigned to that issue before submitting a pull request. This minimizes the chance of multiple different contributors duplicating work by submitting a pull request for the same issue. If you submit a pull request to an issue without first being assigned to it, that pull request may not be accepted. Once the pull request is merged, you can claim the bounty.

## Reward Distribution 
In order to distribute rewards after closing the issue, contributors must submit a [Bounty Claim](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/issues)
 in the issue section which will notify the Filecoin Foundation team regarding their work and payment details.
